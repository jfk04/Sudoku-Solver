# 🧩 Sudoku-Solver

## 📌 Introduction
With this Sudoku Solver, you can solve Sudokus in the blink of an eye. It uses a backtracking algorithm with an UI as visualization so you can see the process.
You can also play Sudoku yourself by entering numbers manually. But that would be pretty boring, right?

## 🛠 Technnologies I used
Python all the way 🐍 <br>
For the visualization I used Pygame. Tkinter would also be an option but I chose pygame because I've already worked with it in the past.

## ✨ Features
Users can:
- ▶️ Solve a Sudoku automatically using a backtracking algorithm
- 🧠 Watch the solving process step by step
- ⌨️ Enter numbers manually and play Sudoku themselves
- ❌ Get visual feedback for incorrect inputs
- 🎨 Delete numbers and built your own Sudoku

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Mouse Click** – Select a cell
- **1–9** – Enter a number into the selected cell
- **Backspace / Delete** – Clear the selected cell
- **Arrow Keys** – Navigate between cells

## 📚 What I Learned
- The **`yield` keyword and how to use generators**
- How **backtracking algorithms** work
- Separating **logic and UI**
- Handling mutable data structures (deep copies vs references)
- Building interactive applications with **pygame**

## 🚀 Possible Improvements
- Add a Sudoku generator with difficulty levels
- Implement a timer and a set number of try's
- Little numbers, that you can write in the corner of a cell
